					<h4>Useful is forever</h4>
					<p>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.
					</p>

				<div class="mission">
					<h3>2</h3>
					<h4>Great service is everything</h4>
					<p>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day.
					</p>

				<div class="mission">
					<h3>3</h3>
					<h4>Clarity is king</h4>
					<p>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.

					<h3>4</h3>
					<h4>Our customers are our investors</h4>
					<p>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.

					<h3>5</h3>
					<h4>The basics are beautiful</h4>
					<p>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mission">
					<h3>6</h3>
					<h4>No hidden fees or secret prices</h4>
					<p>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mission">
					<h3>7</h3>
					<h4>Software should be easy</h4>
					<p>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't tell you training because you don't need it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mission bottom">
					<h3>8</h3>
					<h4>Long-term contracts are obscene</h4>
					<p>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</p>
